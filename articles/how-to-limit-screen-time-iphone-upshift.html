<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Steps to limit screen time on iPhone:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Tip #1: Use an app blocker</h2>

<p>Starting with iOS 16, there are apps that make it easy to block apps & websites. Search "website blocker" or "app blocker" on the App Store and see which app works for you. <strong>Upshift</strong> is one option. See also Best Apps to Limit Screen Time on iPhone.</p>

<p>App blockers are effective. Why? Social media companies increase engagement by reducing friction. For example, TikTok is frictionless because you can easily swipe down and keep watching super-engaging, tailored-for-you videos. App blockers <em><strong>increase</strong></em> friction. Even if you keep unblocking TikTok, as long as you keep using an app blocker, you will reduce engagement because of the extra friction of needing to open another app to temporarily unblock TikTok.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Turn off notifications for non-essential apps</h2>

<p>Notifications are designed to grab your attention and pull you back into apps, often for things that aren't urgent or important. In other words, notifications are <em><strong>designed</strong></em> to increase your screen time! By turning them off, you regain control over when and how you interact with your phone.</p>

<p>Consider these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Declare "notification bankruptcy" by turning off notifications for all but the most essential apps.</li>
<li>When a new app prompts you to enable notifications, choose "Don't Allow."</li>
</ol>

<h4>Open "Settings" App</h4>

<h4>Locate Non-Essential App Settings</h4>

<h2>Tip #3: Keep 'Do Not Disturb' on at all times</h2>

<p>Similar to turning off notifications, Do Not Disturb is another tool that creates a less distracting environment. Do Not Disturb silences calls, messages, and notifications. You can customize it to allow calls from certain contacts or for specific apps.</p>

<h2>Tip #4: Hide apps</h2>

<p>Hiding distracting or time-consuming apps can reduce the temptation to open them impulsively. Here are a few ways to increase the friction of accessing these apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move the app to a different Home Screen page.</li>
<li>Place the app inside a folder, then drag it to a different page within the folder.</li>
<li>Remove the app from your Home Screen: press and hold the app > select "Remove App" > choose "Remove from Home Screen."</li>
<li>Remove the app from Siri & Search: open the "Settings" app > find the specific app's settings (e.g., "Instagram") > tap "Siri & Search" > toggle everything off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tip #5: Create phone-free zones</h2>

<p>Your surroundings play a big role in your phone habits. If your phone is always within reach—like on your bedside table—it's easier to fall into the habit of mindlessly checking it. By creating physical barriers, you'll make it easier to break the habit of constantly reaching for your device. Try making these changes to your environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep your phone out of the bedroom; use a physical alarm clock instead.</li>
<li>Store your phone in a drawer or another room when focusing on tasks.</li>
<li>Place your phone out of reach during meals to encourage mindful eating and conversation.</li>
<li>Set up a charging station away from common areas to discourage casual use.</li>
<li>Avoid bringing the phone into the bathroom.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tip #6: Explore offline activities</h2>

<p>This might sound obvious, but if you have nothing better to do than to check the phone, of course you will check the phone! The phone offers <em>excellent</em> entertainment, so you need to consciously choose to replace it with other activities. Consider these suggestions to start with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sports</li>
<li>Nature walks (e.g., hiking)</li>
<li>Reading books</li>
</ul>
